QuickBit
========

Quick and mostly redundant torrent searching and downloading tool.

- Search for anything
- The list of torrents is sorted according to number of seeds, highest having the most number of seeds.
- Directly adds torrents to your BitTorrent client (Magnet link) when you click download.


Note - Sometimes the main RSS server is down, so the app uses a fallback server. 
Downside to fallback server is that it doesn't open directly into the BitTorrent client, but opens up a webpage.

Note #2 - I am totally not liable for you being arrested for downloading weird porn, that's totally your thing bro.
