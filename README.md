QuickBit
========

Quick and neat torrent searching and downloading tool. 

- Pretty quick
- Search for anything
- Displays Size, Seeds and Peers
- The list of torrents is sorted according to number of seeds, highest having the most number of seeds.
- Directly add torrents to your BitTorrent client (Magnet link) when you click download.
- Or click open to open the webpage for the torrent.
- AutoMode, picks the torrent with the higest seeds and adds it as you search (Can be toggled)
- Lightweight, less than 800 Kb in size
- Standalone, no installation required
- Multiplatform (Magnet links don't open on Mac)
- Looks nice too.

The application parses custom RSS feeds made by my web app using a custom RSS parser and uses the URISchemeHandler Library to open magnet links in default BitTorrent clients.
